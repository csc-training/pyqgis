    "Yesterday, you learned the basics of PyQGIS: how to run code from the embedded Python console, how to use the central classes (such as QgsVectorLayer) and run operations of layer geometries and attributes. However, the strength of QGIS is its vast library of geospatial algorithms (both native and those added by plugins, such as GRASS) coupled with general data crunching tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "In these practicals, you will learn how to run processing algorithms via PyQGIS, even chaining multiple operations together and running batch processes on multiple layers. You will create automated processes using the graphic Model Builder and expand on the models with Python. The point of these exercises is to learn how to use Python in QGIS to create reproducible and easily shareable tools for automated spatial analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final section is a brief look at QGIS plugin development – what are plugins, when to develop them, what are the basic parts of plugins and the underlying tools, like the QT framework. There's also a challenge related to modifying and adding to a simple graphical plugin."

    "This section serves as a brief introduction to plugins in QGIS. First, there's a discussion on why plugins are made through a few examples. Then the basic building blocks of a plugin are introduced. Throughout, there're links to various resources where you may read more on specific aspects of plugin development, if you're interested in engaging it yourself. The section is followed by a challenge where you may modify and examine a simple pre-made plugin."

    "## 2.1. Plugins: what are they good for?\n",
    "QGIS consists both of [core plugins](https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/en/docs/user_manual/plugins/plugins.html#core-and-external-plugins), maintained by the program developers themselves, and external plugins by independent developers. So, plugins extend the base program in some way. But what does this mean in practice?\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of times the plugins integrate some external service's functionality to QGIS: for example by allowing flexible download of rasters from [GeoCubes Finland](https://github.com/geoportti/GeoCubes-Finland-QGIS-Plugin) or to [add resources](https://qgis-contribution.github.io/QGIS-ResourceSharing/authoring/what-to-share.html) like processing scripts, styles and SVG images directly to QGIS from online repositories. Both of these plugins sport a custom graphical user interface:"

    "Sometimes the plugins add a neat new functionality, like [adding a globe visualization](https://github.com/GispoCoding/GlobeBuilder) to the current project. If such functions are deemed useful enough, they might be intergrated natively to the program over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A custom user interface isn't a necessity for plugins. [Openlayers plugin](https://github.com/sourcepole/qgis-openlayers-plugin) has its main functionality (adding background maps) in a drop-down menu. [QNEAT3](https://root676.github.io/), a network analysis library, is a processing plugin: it adds a new provider and a bunch of scripts. The description of QNEAT3 mentions that some scripts require matplotlib Python plotting library: since QGIS includes a Python installation (on Windows), external libraries can easily be pip installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the examples above show, QGIS plugins can extend the base program in many forms. However, these materials focus on ones with custom GUI's.\n",
    "\n",
    "When is it beneficial to engage in plugin development? Plugin development can be time-consuming and not worth the while if you simply want to share a quick and dirty script with a co-worker. Models and processing scripts, too, are simpler than full GUI plugins since they have functionality to easily e.g. ask user for input and output paths. From the examples above, creating a GUI plugin might pay off when you have a service you want to reach more people or believe you can add a new necessary feature not possible with the existing tools."

    "\n",
    "A central QT concept is signals and slots. These two are used to connect what the user does to actions in the program: signal sends the information that something has been done and slot is the reaction. Signals can carry information related to the action made by the user or the state of the system, and then pass these to the slots, which are often Python functions. For a thorough discussion of these concepts, see [Nils Nolde's tutorial](https://gis-ops.com/qgis-3-plugin-tutorial-pyqt-signal-slot-explained/).\n",

    "As an example of the signal/slot system in action, pressing _Zoom to layer_ ![Zoom to layer icon](images/zoom_to_layer.JPG)\n",
