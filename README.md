# PyQGIS-materials
 
## Course information:
 
This course gives a practical introduction to PyQGIS, the Python implementation in QGIS. Through hands-on exercises, you will learn to run Python code through the built-in console, create scripts, automate processes with the graphical Model Builder and processing tools, and create a simple graphical QGIS plugin.

**Lecturer and author of materials: Tatu Leppämäki (University of Helsinki)**

### Learning outcome

The aim of this lesson is to get started with using Python in QGIS. You will learn not only how to use PyQGIS in different ways but also when to utilize it over QGIS’s graphical interface. You will be familiarized with documentation and additional resources at each step and know where to look for more information.

### Prerequisites
