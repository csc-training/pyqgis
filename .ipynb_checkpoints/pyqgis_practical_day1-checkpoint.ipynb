    "The core application and libraries of QGIS are programmed in C++. However, Python is integrated into every nook and cranny of QGIS. All external plugins are written in Python; pretty much everything that can be done in the UI can be done via the Python bindings (a.k.a. API, Application Programming Interface); generic Python code and scripts can be run through the integrated console; custom functions can be run through the processing tools or on attribute tables. All in all, Python is seamlessly tied with QGIS at every step.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the first section of this short course, you will learn the basics of Python in QGIS: how to interact with the QGIS interface via the Python console, how to handle vector fields and geometries and how to use expression effectively with QGIS. You will learn how to run PyQGIS code through a terminal and scripts. Along the way, you will learn the central concepts which will be built on in tomorrows processing and plugins section."
