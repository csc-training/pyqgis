    "Yesterday, you learned the basics of PyQGIS: how to run code from the embedded Python console, how to use the central classes (such as QgsVectorLayer) and run operations of layer geometries and attributes. However, the strength of QGIS is its vast library of geospatial algorithms (both native and those added by plugins, such as GRASS) coupled with general data crunching tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "In these practicals, we will learn how to run processing algorithms via PyQGIS, even chaining multiple operations together. We will create automated processes using the graphic Model Builder and link it with our Python code. The point of these exercises is to learn how to use Python in QGIS to create reproducible and easily shareable tools for spatial analysis needs.\n",
